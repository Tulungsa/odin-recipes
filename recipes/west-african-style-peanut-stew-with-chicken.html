                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>
                    Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and the black pepper. Heat 1 
                    tablespoon oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add half the chicken;
                    cook until no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a plate. 
                    Repeat with 1 tablespoon oil and remaining chicken.

                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pot and reduce heat to medium. Add onion;
                    cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, coriander, cumin, turmeric,
                    cinnamon, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring, 30 seconds.

                    Stir in broth, tomatoes, sweet potato, collard greens, and red bell peppers;
                    bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, partially covered, until 
                    vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.

                    Return chicken and accumulated juices to the pot. Return to a boil,
                    then stir in peanut butter; simmer until incorporated and chicken is cooked
                    through, 3 to 5 minutes. Garnish with chopped peanuts.
