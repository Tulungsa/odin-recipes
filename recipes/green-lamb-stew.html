            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This is a wonderful and easy stovetop preparation that is a hearty
                meal for the whole family. I often serve it over rice or orzo, with
                a nice tomato and cucumber salad and good bread. A simple,fresh, and
                delicious taste of the Greek Isles!

                    <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium-high heat.
                    Season the lamb with salt and pepper, add to the pot,and cook until deeply
                    browned, about 5 minutes on each side. Stir in the onions and garlic, and
                    cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.

                <li>
                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    Pour the wine into the pot, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food
                    off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir in the tomatoes, tomato sauce,
                    lamb stock, lemon zest and juice, oregano, cinnamon, and bay leaf. Bring back to a
                    boil over  high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the
                    lamb is very tender, about 1<sup>1/2</sup> hours. Stir in the green beans and cook until 
                    they are tender, about 20 additional minutes.

                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
